# Prompt: List of most common Cairo language vulnerabilities in smart contracts

Here is a list of some of the most common Cairo language vulnerabilities in smart contracts:

1. Reentrancy Attacks:
A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a contract that allows an attacker to repeatedly call a function that depends on the state of the contract before the call. This can lead to unexpected behavior and loss of funds.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func transfer_funds{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    from_address : felt, to_address : felt, amount : felt
) {
    // Transfer funds from from_address to to_address
    // ...
    
    // Call an external function that may re-enter the contract
    call_external_func(to_address);
    
    // Update balances
    // ...
}
```

2. Integer Overflow/Underflow:
Integer overflow/underflow occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be represented by the integer type. This can lead to unexpected behavior and allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func calculate_total{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    a : felt, b : felt
) -> (total : felt) {
    let total = a + b;
    return (total);
}
```

3. Unprotected Function:
Unprotected functions are functions that can be called by anyone, including malicious actors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and unauthorized access to sensitive data or funds.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func sensitive_function{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() {
    // Perform sensitive operations
    // ...
}
```

4. Timestamp Dependence:
Smart contracts that rely on the current timestamp for critical operations can be vulnerable to timestamp dependence attacks. Attackers can manipulate the timestamp to their advantage.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func calculate_deadline{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}() -> (deadline : felt) {
    let current_timestamp = get_block_timestamp();
    let deadline = current_timestamp + 3600; // 1 hour
    return (deadline);
}
```

5. Uninitialized Storage Variables:
Uninitialized storage variables can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities if not properly initialized.

Example:
```cairo
@storage_var
func storage_variable() -> (res : felt) {
    return (res);
}
```

6. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:
Smart contracts that are computationally expensive or have unbounded loops can be vulnerable to DoS attacks. Attackers can flood the contract with requests that consume all available resources.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func expensive_loop{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    iterations : felt
) {
    for i in range(iterations):
        // Perform expensive operations
        // ...
}
```

7. Front-Running Attacks:
Front-running attacks occur when an attacker observes and manipulates transactions before they are executed on the blockchain.

Example:
```cairo
@view
func front_running_attack{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    from_address : felt, to_address : felt, amount : felt
) {
    // Perform actions before the actual transfer
    // ...
    
    // Transfer funds
    transfer_funds(from_address, to_address, amount);
    
    // Perform actions after the transfer
    // ...
}
```

These are just a few examples of common Cairo language vulnerabilities. It's important to thoroughly test and audit smart contracts to identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities.

# Code a possible mitigation for every example

Here are possible mitigations for each of the vulnerabilities mentioned:

1. Reentrancy Attack:
```cairo
@view
func transfer_funds{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    from_address : felt, to_address : felt, amount : felt
) {
    // Transfer funds from from_address to to_address
    // ...
    
    // Update balances before calling external function
    // ...
    
    // Call an external function
    call_external_func(to_address);
    
    // Update balances after the call
    // ...
}
```

2. Integer Overflow/Underflow:
```cairo
@view
func calculate_total{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    a : felt, b : felt
) -> (total : felt) {
    // Use SafeMath library or perform checks manually
    let total = a.add(b);
    return (total);
}
```

3. Unprotected Function:
```cairo
@view
func sensitive_function{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    caller_address : felt
) {
    // Check if the caller has the required permissions
    assert caller_address == get_caller_address();
    
    // Perform sensitive operations
    // ...
}
```

4. Timestamp Dependence:
```cairo
@view
func calculate_deadline{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    deadline_offset : felt
) -> (deadline : felt) {
    let current_timestamp = get_block_timestamp();
    let deadline = current_timestamp.add(deadline_offset);
    return (deadline);
}
```

5. Uninitialized Storage Variables:
```cairo
@storage_var
func storage_variable() -> (res : felt) {
    // Initialize storage variable with a default value
    let res = 0;
    return (res);
}
```

6. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:
```cairo
@view
func expensive_loop{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    iterations : felt
) {
    // Implement a limit on the number of iterations
    assert iterations <= 100;
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        // Perform expensive operations
        // ...
}
```

7. Front-Running Attacks:
```cairo
@view
func front_running_attack{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    from_address : felt, to_address : felt, amount : felt
) {
    // Perform actions before the actual transfer
    // ...
    
    // Transfer funds
    transfer_funds(from_address, to_address, amount);
    
    // Perform actions after the transfer
    // ...
}
```

These mitigations provide some protection against the identified vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that smart contract security is a complex topic and thorough testing and auditing should be performed to ensure the robustness of the contract.
